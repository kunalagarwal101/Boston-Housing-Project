## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview
In this project, I have applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, splited the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. Then analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enable to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

Things comvered in this project:

- How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
- How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
- How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
- How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

## Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, you decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist you and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, you\'ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Your task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for your clients\' homes.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Starting the Project
This project contains three files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
